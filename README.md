CS-502 Deep Learning Project
Louis-Alexandre Leger, 311047, Team 44
For the end of semester project, I have chosen option #3: “Research in the wild”. The
main theme that will be explored is the one of Vision transformers and their usefulness in image
classification in comparison to more classical convolutional neural networks.

To summarize, the contribution of this project will mostly be to fair ViTs against CNNs and
investigate and perhaps propose novels tokenization strategies to classify super high resolution
oncological histology images.
